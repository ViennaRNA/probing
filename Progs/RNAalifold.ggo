description "reads aligned RNA sequences from stdin or file.aln and calculates\
 their minimum free energy (mfe) structure, partition function (pf) and base\
 pairing probability matrix. Currently, the input alignment has to be in\
 CLUSTAL format. It returns the mfe structure in bracket notation, its\
 energy, the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble and the frequency of\
 the mfe structure in the ensemble to stdout.  It also produces Postscript\
 files with plots of the resulting secondary structure graph (\"alirna.ps\")\
 and a \"dot plot\" of the base pairing matrix (\"alidot.ps\"). The file\
 \"alifold.out\" will contain a list of likely pairs sorted by credibility,\
 suitable for viewing  with \"AliDot.pl\". Be warned that output file will\
 overwrite any existing files of the same name."

# Options
option  "cfactor"         - "Set the weight of the covariance term in the energy function"  default="1.0" double
option  "nfactor"         - "Set the penalty for non-compatible sequences in the covariance term of the energy\
 function"  default="1.0" double
option  "endgaps"         E "Score pairs with endgaps same as gap-gap pairs."  flag  off
option  "mis"             - "Output \"most informative sequence\" instead of simple consensus: For each\
 column of the alignment output the set of nucleotides with frequence greater than average in IUPAC notation." flag  off
option  "partfunc"        p "Calculate the partition function and base pairing probability matrix in\
 addition to the mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe structure only. In addition to the MFE structure\
 we print a coarse representation of the pair probabilities in form of a pseudo bracket notation, followed by\
 the ensemble free energy, as well as the centroid structure derived from the pair probabilities together with\
 its free energy and distance to the ensemble. Finally it prints the frequency of the mfe structure.\n\nAn\
 additionally passed value to this option changes the behavior of partition function calculation:\n-p0\
 \tCalculate the partition function but not the pair probabilities, saving about 50% in runtime. This\
 prints the ensemble free energy -kT ln(Z).\n\n" int default="1" argoptional optional
option  "noLP"            - "Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1). For partition\
 function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally\
 occur as helices of length 1."  flag  off
option  "circ"            c "Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA molecule."  flag  off
option  "color"           - "Produce a colored version of the consensus strcture plot \"alirna.ps\"\
 (default b&w only)"  flag  off
option  "aln"             - "Produce a colored and structure annotated alignment in PostScript format in\
 the file \"aln.ps\" in the current directory."  flag  off
option  "stochBT"         s "Stochastic backtrack. Compute a certain number of random structures with a\
 probability dependend on the partition function. See -p option in RNAsubopt."  int optional
option  "stochBT_en"      - "same as \"-s\" but also print out the energies and probabilities of the\
 backtraced structures."  int optional
option  "ribosum_file"    R "use specified Ribosum Matrix instead of normal energy model. Matrixes to\
 use should be 6x6 matrices, the order of the terms is AU, CG, GC, GU, UA, UG." string typestr="ribosumfile" optional
option  "ribosum_scoring" r "use ribosum scoring matrix. The matrix is chosen according to the minimal\
 and maximal pairwise identities of the sequences in the file." flag  off
option  "old"             - "use old energy evaluation, treating gaps as characters." flag  off
option  "temp"            T "Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp C. Default is 37C." double
option  "dangles"         d "How to treat \"dangling end\" energies for bases adjacent to helices in free ends\
 and multi-loops:\n\nWith -d2 dangling energies will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on both sides\
 in any case.\n\n-d0 ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging)."  int default="2"  optional
option  "noTetra"         4 "Do not include special stabilizing energies for certain tetra-loops. Mostly for\
 testing." flag off

option  "energyModel"     e "Rarely used option to fold sequences from the artificial ABCD... alphabet, where\
 A pairs B, C-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (-e 1) or AU (-e 2) pairs."  int optional
option  "paramFile"       P "Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of using the default parameter set.\
 A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.\nSee the RNAlib documentation for details on the\
 file format." string typestr="paramfile" optional
option  "nsp"             - "Allow other pairs in addition to the usual AU,GC,and GU pairs.\nIts argument is\
 a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the first character is a \"-\" then AB will imply\
 that AB and BA are allowed pairs.\ne.g. RNAfold -nsp -GA  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are\
 given 0 stacking energy."  string optional
option  "constraint"      C "Calculate structures subject to constraints.\nConstraints will be read from stdin,\
 the alignment has to given as a filename on the command line. Constraints may be encoded with the symbols:\n.\
 (no constraint for this base)\n| (the corresponding base has to be paired\nx (the base is unpaired)\n< (base i is paired with\
 a base j>i)\n> (base i is paired with a base j<i)\nand matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)\nWith the\
 exception of \"|\", constraints will disallow all pairs conflicting with the constraint. This is usually\
 sufficient to enforce the constraint, but occasionally a base may stay unpaired in spite of constraints. PF\
 folding ignores constraints of type \"|\"."  flag off
option  "pfScale"         S "In the calculation of the pf use scale*mfe as an estimate for the ensemble\
 free energy (used to avoid overflows). The default is 1.07, useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed\
 for long sequences.\nYou can also recompile the program to use double precision (see the README file)."  double
