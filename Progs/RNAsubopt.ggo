description "reads RNA sequences from stdin and (in the default -e mode) calculates all suboptimal secondary\
 structures within a user defined energy range above the minimum free energy (mfe). It prints the suboptimal\
 structures in dot-bracket notation followed by the energy in kcal/mol to stdout. Be careful, the number of\
 structures returned grows exponentially with both sequence length and energy range.\n\nAlternatively, when\
 used with the -p option, RNAsubopt produces Boltzmann weighted samples of secondary structures.\n"

# Options

option  "deltaEnergy" e
"Compute suboptimal structures with energy in a certain range of the optimum (kcal/mol).\
 Default is calculation of mfe structure only.\n"
float
typestr="range"
optional

option  "deltaEnergyPost" -
"Only print structures with energy within range of the mfe after post reevaluation of energies.\n"
details="Useful in conjunction with -logML, -d1 or -d3: while the -e option specifies the range\
 before energies are re-evaluated, this option specifies the maximum energy after re-evaluation.\n"
float
typestr="range"
optional

option  "sorted"  s
"Sort the structures by energy.\n"
details="Since the sort in is done in memory, this becomes impractical when the number of structures produced\
 goes into millions. In such cases better pipe the output through \"sort +1n\".\n"
flag
off

option "stochBT"  p
"Instead of producing all suboptimals in an energy range, produce a random sample of suboptimal structures,\
 drawn with probabilities equal to their Boltzmann weights via stochastic backtracking in the partition\
 function. The -e and -p options are mutually exclusive."
int
typestr="number"
optional

option  "dos" D
"Compute density of states instead of secondary structures\n"
details="This option enables the evaluation of the number of secondary structures in certain energy bands arround\
 the MFE.\n"
flag
off

option  "zuker" z
"Compute Zuker suboptimals instead of all suboptimal structures within an engery band arround the MFE\n."
flag
off

# default ViennaRNAPackage options

option  "temp"  T
"Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp C. Default is 37C.\n"
double
typestr="temperature"
optional

option  "constraint"  C
"Calculate structures subject to constraints.\n"
details="The program reads first the\
 sequence, then a string containing constraints on the structure encoded with the symbols:\n. (no constraint\
 for this base)\n| (the corresponding base has to be paired\nx (the base is unpaired)\n< (base i is paired with\
 a base j>i)\n> (base i is paired with a base j<i)\nand matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)\nWith the\
 exception of \"|\", constraints will disallow all pairs conflicting with the constraint. This is usually\
 sufficient to enforce the constraint, but occasionally a base may stay unpaired in spite of constraints. PF\
 folding ignores constraints of type \"|\".\n"
flag
off

option  "noTetra" 4
"Do not include special stabilizing energies for certain tetra-loops. Mostly for testing.\n"
flag
off

option  "dangles" d
"How to treat \"dangling end\" energies for bases adjacent to helices in free ends and multi-loops\n"
details="If -d1 or -d3 are specified the structures are generated as with -d2 but energies are\
 re-evaluated before printing.\n"
int
default="2"
optional

option  "logML" -
"Recalculate energies of structures using a logarithmic energy function for multi-loops before output."
details="This option does not effect structure generation, only the energies that are printed out.\
 Since logML lowers energies somewhat, some structures may be missing.\n"
flag
off

option  "noLP"  -
"Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1).\n"
details="For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur isolated. Other\
 pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.\n"
flag
off

option  "noGU"  -
"Do not allow GU pairs\n"
flag
off

option  "noClosingGU" -
"Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices\n"
flag
off

option  "noconv"  -
"Do not automatically substitude nucleotide \"T\" with \"U\"\n"
flag
off

option  "nsp" -
"Allow other pairs in addition to the usual AU,GC,and GU pairs.\n"
details="Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the\
 first character is a \"-\" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed pairs.\ne.g.\
 RNAfold -nsp -GA  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are given 0 stacking\
 energy.\n"
string
optional

option  "paramFile" P
"Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of using the default parameter set.\n"
details="A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.\nSee the RNAlib\
 documentation for details on the file format.\n"
string
typestr="paramfile"
optional

option  "pfScale" S
"In the calculation of the pf use scale*mfe as an estimate for the ensemble\
 free energy (used to avoid overflows). The default is 1.07, useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed\
 for long sequences.\nYou can also recompile the program to use double precision (see the README file).\n"
double
typestr="scaling factor"
optional

option  "circ"  c
"Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA molecule.\n"
flag
off
