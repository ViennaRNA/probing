description "works much like RNAfold, but allows to specify two RNA sequences wich are\
 then allowed to form a dimer structure. RNA sequences are read from stdin in the usual\
 format, i.e. each line of input corresponds to one sequence, except for lines starting\
 with \">\" which contain the name of the next sequence.\nTo compute the hybrid structure\
 of two molecules, the two sequences must be concatenated using the \'&\' character as\
 separator.\nRNAcofold can compute minimum free energy (mfe) structures, as well as\
 partition function (pf) and base pairing probability matrix (using the -p switch)\nSince\
 dimer formation is concentration dependent, RNAcofold can be used to compute equilibrium\
 concentrations for all five monomer and (homo/hetero)-dimer species, given input\
 concentrations for the monomers.\nOutput consists of the mfe structure in bracket\
 notation as well as PostScript structure plots and \"dot plot\" files containing the\
 pair probabilities, see the RNAfold man page for details. In the dot plots a cross marks\
 the chain break between the two concatenated sequences.\nThe program will continue to\
 read new sequences until a line consisting of the single character @ or an end of file\
 condition is encountered."

# Options
option  "temp"  T
"Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp C. Default is 37C.\n"
double

option  "partfunc"  p
"Calculate the partition function and base pairing probability matrix in\
 addition to the mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe structure only.\n"
details="In addition to the MFE structure\
 we print a coarse representation of the pair probabilities in form of a pseudo bracket notation, followed by\
 the ensemble free energy, as well as the centroid structure derived from the pair probabilities together with\
 its free energy and distance to the ensemble. Finally it prints the frequency of the mfe structure, and the\
 structural diversity (mean distance between the structures in the ensemble).\nSee the description of pf_fold()\
 and mean_bp_dist() and centroid() in the RNAlib documentation for details.\nNote that unless you also specify\
 -d2 or -d0, the partition function and mfe calculations will use a slightly different energy model. See the\
 discussion of dangling end options below.\n\nAn additionally passed value to this option changes the behavior\
 of partition function calculation:\n\n\
-p0\tCalculate the partition function but not the pair probabilities, saving about 50% in runtime. This\
 prints the ensemble free energy -kT ln(Z).\n"
int
default="1"
argoptional
optional

option "all_pf" a
"Compute the partition function and free energies not only of the hetero-dimer consisting\
 of the two input sequences (the \"AB dimer\"), but also of the homo-dimers AA and BB as\
 well as A and B monomers.\n"
details="The output will contain the free energies for each of these species, as well as\
 5 dot plots containing the conditional pair probabilities, called ABname5.ps, AAname5.ps\
 and so on. For later use, these dot plot files also contain the free energy of the\
 ensemble as a comment. Using -a automatically toggles the -p option.\n"
flag
off

option  "concentrations"  c
"In addition to everything listed under the -a option, read in initial monomer concentrations\
 and compute the expected equilibrium concentrations of the 5 possible species (AB, AA, BB, A, B).\n"
details="Start concentrations are read from stdin (unless the -f option is used) in [mol/l],\
 equilibrium concentrations are given realtive to the sum of the two inputs. An arbitrary number\
 of initial concentrations can be specified (one pair of concentrations per line).\n"
flag
off

option  "concfile"  f
"Specify a file with initial concentrations for the to sequences."
details="The table consits of arbitrary many lines with just two numbers (the concentration of\
 sequence A and B). This option will automatically toggle the -c (and thus -a and -p) options (see above).\n"
string
typestr="filename"
optional

option  "constraint"  C
"Calculate structures subject to constraints.\n"
details="The program reads first the\
 sequence, then a string containing constraints on the structure encoded with the symbols:\n. (no constraint\
 for this base)\n| (the corresponding base has to be paired\nx (the base is unpaired)\n< (base i is paired with\
 a base j>i)\n> (base i is paired with a base j<i)\nand matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)\nWith the\
 exception of \"|\", constraints will disallow all pairs conflicting with the constraint. This is usually\
 sufficient to enforce the constraint, but occasionally a base may stay unpaired in spite of constraints. PF\
 folding ignores constraints of type \"|\".\n"
flag
off

option  "noTetra" 4
"Do not include special stabilizing energies for certain tetra-loops. Mostly for testing.\n"
flag
off

option  "dangles" d
"How to treat \"dangling end\" energies for bases adjacent to helices in free ends and multi-loops\n"
details="\nWith (-d1) only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end, this is the\
 default for mfe folding but unsupported for the partition function folding.\n\nWith -d2 this check is ignored,\
 dangling energies will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the\
 default for partition function folding (-p).\n\n-d0 ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for\
 debugging).\n\nWith -d3 mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in multi-loops. At the\
 moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3\
 and works only for mfe folding.\n\nNote that by default (as well as with -d1 and -d3) pf and mfe folding\
 treat dangling ends differently. Use -d2 in addition to -p to ensure that both algorithms use the same\
 energy model.\n"
int
default="1"
optional

option  "noLP"  -
"Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1).\n"
details="For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur isolated. Other\
 pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.\n"  flag  off

option  "noGU"  -
"Do not allow GU pairs\n"
flag
off

option  "noClosingGU" -
"Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices\n"
flag
off

option  "noconv"  -
"Do not automatically substitude nucleotide \"T\" with \"U\"\n"
flag
off

option  "nsp" -
"Allow other pairs in addition to the usual AU,GC,and GU pairs.\n"
details="Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the\
 first character is a \"-\" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed pairs.\ne.g.\
 RNAfold -nsp -GA  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are given 0 stacking\
 energy.\n"
string
optional

option  "energyModel" e
"Rarely used option to fold sequences from the artificial ABCD... alphabet, where\
 A pairs B, C-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (-e 1) or AU (-e 2) pairs.\n"
int
optional

option  "paramFile" P
"Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of using the default parameter set.\n"
details="A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.\nSee the RNAlib\
 documentation for details on the file format.\n"
string
typestr="filename"
optional

option  "pfScale" S
"In the calculation of the pf use scale*mfe as an estimate for the ensemble\
 free energy (used to avoid overflows)."
details="The default is 1.07, useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed\
 for long sequences.\nYou can also recompile the program to use double precision\
 (see the README file).\n"
